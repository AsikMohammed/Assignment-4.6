1. Number Of DataNodes:
      To Calculate the number of data nodes(n) :-
            The Formula for Calculating the Number Of DataNodes
                               n=H/d
            
            where n = Number of Data Nodes,
                  H = Initial Data Size,
                  d = Available disk space per node
            Here, H = 600TB
              and d = 7TB
              
              Therefore, n = H/d = 600/7
                         n = 86
           Hence the number of data nodes required are 86.
